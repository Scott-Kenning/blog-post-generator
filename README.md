This is a website I created to play around with OpenAI after I used it on my work term. It's labelled as a blog post creation website, but what I've found it more useful for is giving detailed descriptions of stuff, for example when someone mentions a technology or framework I'm unfamiliar with. It uses some very basic prompting strategies to produce output of higher quality than one would get by just asking ChatGPT to "write a blog post about ____", and then gives the user the option to refine the blog post based on some limited fedback.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
